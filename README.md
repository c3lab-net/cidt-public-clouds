# Carbon Intensity of Data Transfer (CIDT) on public clouds

We combine Internet routes from the CAIDA ITDK dataset with public cloud IP ranges to figure out the routes between public cloud region pairs, and later use these routes to calculate the end-to-end CIDT.

You can find more details in the [analysis](./analysis/) and [data](./data/) directories.
